# 🧩 Task 2 — The PR Challenge

Welcome to **Task 2** of the FOSS Workshop!  
This task will test your ability to create branches, make clean commits, handle merge conflicts, and manage pull requests like a true open-source contributor 😎

You have **three subtasks**: **Subtask-1**, **Subtask-2**, and **Subtask-3**.  
Each subtask must be completed in a **separate branch**, and all your work must finally appear under a **folder named after your Roll Number (eg: IIT2024243)** in the **main branch** after all PRs are merged.

**Note:** It is stirctly instructed to have the folder name as your roll number and all in UPPERCASE.

---

## 🧠 Subtask-1
In the branch named **Subtask-1**, you will find a file named `details.txt`.

Inside your **Roll Number folder**, for example:
```
IIT2024243/details.txt
```
You have to:
- Write your **Name** and **Roll Number** inside `details.txt`
- Commit your changes
- Create a **Pull Request (PR)** to the main branch

---

## 🔧 Subtask-2
In the branch named **Subtask-2**, you will find a code file named `buggy_code.c` (or `.py`, depending on your language).

Inside your **Roll Number folder**, for example:
```
IIT2024243/buggy_code.c
```
You have to:
- **Fix the errors** in the given code
- Add **comments** explaining:
  - What the error was  
  - What fix you applied
- Commit your changes
- Create a **PR** to the main branch

## 😎 Subtask-3
In the branch named **Subtask-3**, you have to:
- Add a **FOSS-related meme** (formats allowed: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`)
- Place your meme in your **Roll Number folder**, for example:
  ```
  IIT2024243/foss_meme.png
  ```
- Your meme should be **original, creative, and FOSS-themed!**
- Commit your meme file and **create a PR** to the main branch

---

## 🌀 Additional Instructions
- Each subtask must be done in its **own branch** and **own PR**.
- While performing these tasks, make sure to **resolve all merge conflicts** that arise.
- Your final folder structure in the **main branch** should look like this:
  ```
  ├── IIT2024243/
  │   ├── details.txt
  │   ├── buggy_code.c
  │   ├── foss_meme.png
  ```
- Only after **all three PRs are successfully merged**, your **Task 2** will be considered complete ✅.
